-- I downloaded a Digital Media Store Databse containing 11 tables and used SQL to extract data and answer the following questions

-- #1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    CustomerID,
    Country
FROM 
    chinook.customers
WHERE 
    Country <> 'USA';
    
 -- #2 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.
 SELECT 
    customers.FirstName,
    customers.LastName,
    invoices.InvoiceId,
    invoices.InvoiceDate,
    invoices.BillingCountry
FROM 
    invoices
LEFT JOIN 
    customers
ON
     invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId
WHERE
    invoices.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';
    
 -- #3 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table and the amount of invoices per Country
 SELECT
    BillingCountry,
    Count(invoiceId) AS NumInv
FROM
    invoices
GROUP BY 
    BillingCountry;
    
 -- #4 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
 SELECT 
    cust.FirstName AS CustomerFirstName,
    cust.LastName AS CustomerLastName,
    cust.Country AS CustomerCountry,
    emp.FirstName AS EmployeeFirstName,
    emp.Lastname AS EmployeeLastName,
    inv.Total
FROM
    employees AS emp
JOIN customers AS cust
    ON cust.SupportRepID = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices AS inv
    ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID;

-- #5 What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT
   SUM(Total) AS Total_Sales
    FROM 
        invoices
    WHERE 
        InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';
        
-- #6 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT
    tracks.Name AS Track,
    artists.Name AS Artist,
    i.InvoiceLineId
FROM 
    invoice_items AS i 
LEFT JOIN tracks
    ON i.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
JOIN albums 
    ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN artists
    ON artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistID
    
-- #7 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT 
    t.Name AS Track, 
    a.Title AS Album, 
    m.Name AS 'Media Type', 
    g.Name AS Genre
FROM 
    chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
    on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
    on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
    on g.GenreId = t.GenreId;
